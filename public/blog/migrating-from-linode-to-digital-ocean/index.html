<a class=heading-link href=#comparing-digital-ocean-to-linode><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>At the time (two weeks ago) I was hosted with Linode. Linode is a great company and I never had even one issue with their service in the two years I&rsquo;ve been with them. They have a great control panel, DNS manager, and their help and support articles are unmatched. However, the appeal of Digital Ocean could not be ignored, specifically the 4x reduction in cost. I found a great comparison article <a href=http://jasonormand.com/2013/02/08/linode-vs-digitalocean-performance-benchmarks/>benchmarking the two services</a>. The performance gain of the SSD with Digital Ocean compared to a traditional disk drive with Linode is very noticeable. Linode does have Digital Ocean beat in terms of CPU performance though, but for my needs as a web host and general playground, I&rsquo;d much rather have the faster IO time.</p><h3 id=dns-migration>DNS Migration
<a class=heading-link href=#dns-migration><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>I decided to make the shift over to Digital Ocean as soon as I could. I didn&rsquo;t have a whole lot hosted on my linode that I needed to be concerned with (just this website, and a few side projects and freelance sites). Once thing that was a bit of a bother was that I used the DNS manager with Linode for all of my domains. Digital Ocean also has a DNS manager, but it&rsquo;s a new beta feature and I didn&rsquo;t feel confident in it enough to give it a shot just yet. So, before anything, I switched my name servers back to Namecheap to make the migration easier. I could never really decide if it&rsquo;s better to keep my name servers with the registrar or host them elsewhere. I&rsquo;ve switched both registrars and hosting providers often enough in the past that neither seem to weigh more in my mind.</p><h3 id=setting-up-my-droplet>Setting up my Droplet
<a class=heading-link href=#setting-up-my-droplet><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>Linode has incredibly good help articles on setting up various production environments for your needs. In fact, that was part of my initial appeal towards Linode. At the time I was fairly new to setting up and managing a linux OS from scratch, so they proved to be very helpful. Digital Ocean also has a good support library, but it&rsquo;s not as fleshed out as Linode. I&rsquo;ve set up a good amount of VM&rsquo;s in the past year with similar software configurations, so I hit the ground running with this one.</p><p>I created a new &ldquo;droplet&rdquo; with the lowest plan, and kicked it to Ubuntu 12.04 x64. Digital Ocean emails you the root password for the machine after it&rsquo;s kicked (doesn&rsquo;t take long at all), and then you&rsquo;re on your way. I started by installing apache, MySQL, and PHP one at a time using apt-get. The PHP installation on my Linode was a bit more complicated because I was hosting a few sites - but this time around it was just going to be mine.</p><p>I made sure each were running properly after the installation (MySQL in particular requires some additional love, like running mysql_install_db and mysql_secure_installation). It wasn&rsquo;t long before I migrated over my databases and had my website running on my new droplet. I was so excited about the new VPS that I prematurely updated my DNS records to point to the new server&mldr;</p><h3 id=mysql-problems>MySQL Problems!
<a class=heading-link href=#mysql-problems><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>The following day, I would check my site periodically and found that MySQL kept crashing. I checked the MySQL logs - nothing. So I checked the upstart logs for MySQL and found this cryptic error message:</p><pre><code>/usr/bin/mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed
error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (111)'
Check that mysqld is running and that the socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' exists!

</code></pre><p>I didn&rsquo;t come up with many solid answers after researching. I first tried all sorts of things on the database:</p><ol><li>Using <a href=http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqlcheck.html>mysqlcheck</a>. Still crashing</li><li>Making sure all the tables on my DB where set to use InnoDB instead of MyISAM (a good amount were not actually). Still crashing</li><li>Dumping the database, deleting it, and re-importing. Nope, still crashing</li></ol><p>I was finally able to determine that MySQL was running out of memory thus causing the crash. I confirmed this after restarting MySQL, and then running apache benchmark to throw a bunch of traffic at the time. I monitored memory usage as it climbed and eventually ended with MySQL crapping out. I never had this issue on my Linode, and it had the same amount of memory. Then I realized my stupid mistake, I never tweaked my.cnf for my server environment. I had already setup tweaked apache2.conf, but it slipped my mind to configure MySQL the day before.</p><p>It can be a bit daunting to understand how to properly set up a MySQL configuration for your server. There are a lot of things to consider - and most articles you find on the web won&rsquo;t be the magic bullet you&rsquo;re looking for. Ironically I found a <a href=http://www.linode.com/wiki/index.php/MySQL_and_Apache_Optimization_Guide>Linode article</a> on some recommended settings for a small server instance. The settings recommended for my.cnf were drastically different (much lower) than what I had in my default my.cnf file - so I made some adjustments and restarted mysql with good results.</p><h3 id=setting-up-swap>Setting up swap
<a class=heading-link href=#setting-up-swap><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>Even with the MySQL settings set as high as they were, I also found that Digital Ocean does not automatically configure swap for you on the kicked servers. I&rsquo;ve never had to deal with this in the past, and I believe Linode set this up for me (I don&rsquo;t recall doing this myself). Luckily this seemed to be a common question for Digital Ocean. They have a step by <a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-12-04>step by step guide</a> for setting it up on Ubuntu 12.04. Now, even if MySQL runs out of memory, it will start using up swap instead.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion
<a class=heading-link href=#conclusion><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h3><p>It was a bit more work than I anticipated setting up the new VPS with Digital Ocean, but nothing too complicated. These types of problems are what you can expect to run into when setting up a web server from scratch - and it&rsquo;s honestly a great experience and something every web developer should know how to do. After running apache benchmark with the new MySQL settings and Swap setup, I&rsquo;ve yet to run into an issue. I see good performance on the the VPS so far. Digital Ocean is still very new, and I&rsquo;m not sure how long that $5/mo price point will last, but I haven&rsquo;t run into anything with the provider itself. Hopefully things continue to go well!</p></div><footer><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>var disqus_config=function(){};(function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById('disqus_thread').innerHTML='Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.';return}var b=document,a=b.createElement('script');a.async=!0,a.src='//bkosborne.disqus.com/embed.js',a.setAttribute('data-timestamp',+new Date),(b.head||b.body).appendChild(a)})()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
