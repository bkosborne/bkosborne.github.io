The old site has been taken down and will never be seen again&mldr; I originally threw it up in a few days just to showcase my two jQuery plug-ins. I had just about no experience using Drupal (or any other web framework for that matter) at the time that site went up and it was pretty poorly made. Now that I know what I&rsquo;m doing with Drupal, the site was pretty easy to get up and going!</p><p>Here you will still find two pages dedicated to the carousels, but the pages are broken up a bit more now. Additionally, I will begin sifting through the hundreds of emails from the user base with questions, comments, and suggestions for the carousels. To anyone reading to had previously sent me an email: I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t get back to you! It&rsquo;s been a very busy 2010 for me and to be honest the carousels were not a high priority of mine. It will take me a while to go through the emails, but I&rsquo;ll take notes as I do and come up with solid development path for new versions of each carousel. Both carousels are now up on GitHub. I will be using that to manage the carousels from here on out.</p><p>To help the community out, <strong>I&rsquo;ve enabled commenting</strong> on the each carousels landing page. Please utilize the commenting system to post questions regarding the carousel. This will allow the entire community to benefit. I am more likely to respond to issues you have through there than an email.</p><p>I should also note that I&rsquo;ve already published version 1.1 of the waterwheel carousel. I made changes to it a while back and never updated the site&rsquo;s code to display it.
