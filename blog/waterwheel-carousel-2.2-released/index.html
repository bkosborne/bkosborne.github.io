A lot of people have been having trouble with the carousel not loading properly, and I&rsquo;m sure this is because of the image preloader. The carousel has always worked by first attempting to forcefully load all of the images before initializing. This is a well known difficulty within the javascript community. I thought I had a pretty solid preloader finally figured out, but alas people continue to have issues with it.</p><p>Rather than fight the constant new browser releases and possible different handling of image loading, I&rsquo;ve added an option to disable it completely and instead force a width and height for the images. The main point of preloading the images is so that I can work with the actual dimensions of the images. Since most people use the same size images, there&rsquo;s no need for this really. The image dimensions can be added using CSS for each image, or they can be specified globally with the new config options <code>forcedImageWidth</code> and <code>forcedImageHeight</code>. The global specification obviously won&rsquo;t work if you have images that are different dimensions. In that case, don&rsquo;t use these options and define the dimensions for each image using CSS.</p><p>There was also a small bugfix for autoplay where the carousel would continue to rotate even after user interaction should have caused it to stop.</p></div><footer><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>var disqus_config=function(){};(function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById('disqus_thread').innerHTML='Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.';return}var b=document,a=b.createElement('script');a.async=!0,a.src='//bkosborne.disqus.com/embed.js',a.setAttribute('data-timestamp',+new Date),(b.head||b.body).appendChild(a)})()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
