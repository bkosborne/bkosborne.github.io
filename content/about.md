I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Rowan University, where I graduated from in 2010. I immediately began working as a web developer, creating a variety of Drupal websites for around 2 years. I spent about a year and a half with a small tech company building Ruby on Rails applications, and have now transitioned back to working with PHP and Drupal at Princeton University. I consider myself very lucky as not only do I have a strong passion for my career choice, but I'm also in a field where there is so much to learn.
