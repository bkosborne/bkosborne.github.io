I've just tagged [version 1.3](https://github.com/bkosborne/jQuery-Feature-Carousel/zipball/v1.3) of the [Feature Carousel](/node/9). This release includes the following updates

*   Changed structure to support public functions
*   Added four public functions to control carousel
*   Fixed image preloader to work in IE versions
*   A few minor bug fixes

The preloader should finally be fixed - so I hope to see much less people commenting about it :). I've also packaged it up with new pictures that are actual photographs. I did not optimize them for the web so people can ensure that the preloader works. I did some brief testing to check that the carousel works in versions of jQuery from 1.3 and up.

Everyone probably hopes that this brings the added feature of multiple flanking features on either side, but that was not included in this release. It's going to take a bug chunk of my time and commitment to get that done.
