I've managed to get out a new release of the [Feature Carousel](/jquery-feature-carousel). It includes some common feature requests such as next and previous control arrows. In fact, version 1.0 supported them in the code but I never actually utilized them in the HTML for demonstrating.

I've altered the [options](/jquery-feature-carousel/options) and [faq](/jquery-feature-carousel/faq) pages as well. Six new options were added for the feature carousel, including three callback functions that a few people have asked about. I'm almost positive I missed something or screwed up somewhere while editing all of these pages, so be on the look out.

As for the [Waterwheel Carousel](/jquery-waterwheel-carousel), I've released just a small bug fix for the movedToCenter callback and fixed some typos on the [options](/jquery-waterwheel-carousel/options) page.

I hope these changes help everyone out! Don't hesitate to leave comments on the pages or shoot me an email with comments. If you are having issues, check out the FAQ pages before sending me an email please.
